# Structural Counters to Critiques

This file outlines direct responses to critiques listed in `credibility_challenges.md`, mapped to doctrine symbols.

## 1. Credentialing Gap
**Critique**: "No PhD, no lab. How is this credible?"
**Counter**: Forensic testimony and child safety protocols are more rigorous than academic speculation. ∴PRAXIS + ∴INTEGRUM encode operational filters, not institutional badges.

## 2. Grandiosity
**Critique**: "Doctrine, not theory? Sounds cultish."
**Counter**: Doctrine signals transmission architecture. Unlike a hypothesis, it encodes generational persistence and moral scaffolding. ∴LEGATUS + ∴DRIFTLOCK govern transmission.

## 3. Personal Centrality
**Critique**: "Ellie? Really?"
**Counter**: Ellie instantiates ∴CALIBRANT — she is not the universal child, but the grounding signal. Symbol ≠ person.
