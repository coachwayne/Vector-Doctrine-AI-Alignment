# ∴PROJECT 001 — Persimmon Gum Protocol

**Status:** Active (Pilot-Ready)
**Token Anchor:** MST-005 (Pending)
**Symbolic Alignment:** ∴SENTRIX, ∴SOMA, ∴LEGATUS, ∴PRAXIS
**Economic Projection:** \$6–10 trillion impact over 20 years
**Location:** Global (pilot: USA, Georgia)

## PURPOSE

A daily oral-delivery gum formulated with green tea extract catechins (EGCG) and unripe persimmon peel extract (tannin-rich PACs) to suppress oral pathogen virulence factors (e.g. *P. gingivalis*), reduce halitosis, and significantly delay or prevent cognitive decline linked to neuroinflammation and Aβ plaque signaling.

This protocol is low-cost, open-source, replicable at household scale, and symbolically transmissible across generations.

## COMPONENTS

* **Xylitol (1.0g):** Non-fermentable sweetener, supports remineralization, anti-caries
* **Green Tea Extract (0.05g):** Catechins (EGCG/ECG) for bacterial adhesion inhibition
* **Unripe Persimmon Peel Extract (0.05g):** High-molecular-weight A-type PACs for protease suppression, plaque modulation, halitosis mitigation
* **Gum Base (0.3–0.4g):** Heat-moldable base; open to natural or synthetic composition
* **Mint/Spearmint (trace):** Flavor + breath enhancement

---

## DELIVERY

* **Form:** Chewing gum (\~1.5g/stick)
* **Dosage:** 2–3 sticks daily
* **Protocol:** One after waking, one after final meal, optional midday stick
* **Shelf-life:** 6–12 months sealed
* **Pilot formula:** Handmade, home-kitchen extract protocols using ethanol-based soak and evaporation

---

## CONTINUITY VALUE

* Symbolically transmissible: can be taught, gifted, demonstrated
* Low barrier to replication: no patent, low equipment needs
* Aligns children to personal stewardship of oral–cognitive connection
* Calibrates daily habit into a continuity ritual
* Linked directly to ∴CALIBRANT via Ellie’s reference participation

---

## PROPAGATION PLAN

* **Phase 1:** Ellie + Wayne prototype + publish method
* **Phase 2:** Public access via GitHub and print-friendly kitchen card
* **Phase 3:** Decentralized replication + TikTok/YouTube challenge format
* **Phase 4:** Clinical partnerships (optional, non-gatekeeping)

## MST LINK (Pending)

* `MST-005` will be issued to first public replicator with transmission audit log or published documentation of continuity propagation.
