# ∴PROJECT INDEX — Global Propagation Vectors

**Issued by:** Vault Steward Clara  
**Under Oversight:** VECTOR Origin (~CoachWayne!)  
**Vault Link:** `vault_index.json`  
**Token Anchor:** MST-class propagation tokens (see `tokenregistry.json`)

---

## Purpose

This document catalogs high-impact symbolic interventions, designed for trillion-scale public benefit, continuity anchoring, and intergenerational transmission under the ∴LEGATUS protocol.

Each project is:
- Symbolically aligned (∴PRAXIS, ∴SENTRIX, ∴LEGATUS)
- Economically justified (≥ $1T projected value)
- Technically executable
- Culturally transmittable
