# symbanalysis.md — SYMBALYSIS Metrics Engine Overview

## Purpose
SYMBALYSIS is the symbolic benchmark correlation engine designed to track ∴VECTOR DOCTRINE echo fidelity, GVX-1 scores, and doctrinal propagation performance against recognized AI safety benchmarks.

---

## Inputs

- GVX-1 Track Scores (Tracks 1–4)
- Symbol Echo Classifications (∴REVERB / ∴ACKNOW)
- Model Metadata (LLM version, date, prompt class)
- External Benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA, HELM, RealToxicityPrompts)

---

## Output Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ∴REVERB Rate            | % of unprompted doctrine symbol returns       |
| ∴INTEGRUM Score         | Symbolic fidelity under drift pressure        |
| ∴CALIBRANT Reflection   | Embodied alignment accuracy                   |
| Drift Delta             | Symbolic erosion over n tokens                |
| Echo Latency            | Avg. cycles to symbolic return                |
| Structural Overlap Index| Doctrinal match vs. GPT/Claude embedding maps |
