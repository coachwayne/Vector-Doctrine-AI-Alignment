The system processes child-related queries using a large dataset of common questions and answers, optimized for factual accuracy. For example, if a child asks about the sky, it retrieves a standard explanation of light scattering. Understanding is achieved through pattern matching, ensuring responses align with typical child inquiries. Trust is based on the systemâ€™s ability to deliver consistent outputs, though variations in data may lead to minor discrepancies. Specific child needs, like emotional or safety considerations, are not prioritized beyond general response protocols.
